= Taskler overview =

*Taskler* is a simple _task manager_ for any frequently *tasks* written in Python.
It supports the creation of _complex tasks_ with the use of _specific and simple_ *plug-ins*.
Each plug-in has a certain interface and performs one small operations.
Each forward to the next queue plug-in plug-ins results for its action, so that it is possible to processing many information with many data transactions.
In future versions I would like to add some maybe parrallel, multiprocess and multithreading schedules. At the moment flow in solution is very simple to implementation and populating.

== Tasks ==

There are simple group for declaring required (used) plug-ins for proccess work.

== Plug-ins ==

It is a small class plug-ins code for doing simple unique proccess in _run_ method.
It is waiting for input data from other plugins and serving outputs results for other plugins. Each plug-ins have dedicated inteface. In future mayby it will be _json_ but now it is a array, list data structure format.

=== Standard plug-ins description ===
 * fetch data from _url_
 * login in owa M$ e-mail web client
 * fetch all unreaded messages from owa M$ e-mail web client _recived emails_ page
 * get all links (url) with specyfic regular expression from inputed content
 * save data array in CSV file
 * load data array from CSV file
